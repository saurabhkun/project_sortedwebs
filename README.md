## 💡 The Problem
We all have 1,000+ bookmarks buried in browser folders we never open. Existing bookmark managers are **clunky, manual, and boring.**

## ✨ The Solution: SortedWebs
SortedWebs is an intelligent web library that organizes itself.
* **Drag, Drop, Done:** Save links in seconds.
* **Auto-Categorization:** Our local AI engine detects if a link is "Entertainment," "Dev Tool," or "FinTech" instantly.
* **Curated Stacks:** Don't know what tools to use? Explore our "Starter Packs" for Designers, Developers, and Founders.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🧠 1. AI-Powered Smart Sort
Forget manual tagging. Paste a link like `figma.com`, and our engine automatically tags it as **Design**. Paste `zerodha.com`, and it tags it as **Startups/Finance**. It recognizes **300+ platforms** out of the box.

### 📦 2. Curated Stacks (The Pivot)
Discover "Zero-to-One" stacks:
* 🛠 **The Indie Hacker Stack** (Vercel, Supabase, Stripe)
* 🎨 **The UI/UX Bundle** (Figma, Dribbble, Framer)
* *Monetization Ready: Integrated with affiliate logic for revenue.*

### ⚡ 3. Zero-Friction Auth
No email verification needed. We use a **Username-Only** login system backed by Supabase Auth for instant access.

### 🎨 4. Glassmorphism UI
Built with a modern "Dark Mode First" aesthetic using Tailwind CSS and Lucide Icons.
